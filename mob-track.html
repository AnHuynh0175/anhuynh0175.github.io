    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
        • In our Interaction Design class, we focused on the challenge of "The Quantified Self," 
        specifically addressing the difficulty many people face in reflecting on their daily 
        patterns. In the midst of a busy life, where responsibilities like family, school, and 
        work often feel overwhelming, it’s easy to lose track and feel uncertain about what steps 
        to take next. Our goal was to create a solution that helps people better understand and 
        manage their daily routines, giving them clarity and direction in their hectic lives.
 </br>
        • Inspired by this challenge, we developed MobTrack, a mobile app designed to help users 
        track their daily activities. The app allows users to log their routines and then provides 
        insightful activity reports and personalized suggestions based on the data collected. 
        With MobTrack, users can easily monitor their patterns over time, enabling them to reflect 
        on their behaviors and uncover the deeper meaning behind their daily actions. This helps 
        them stay connected to what truly drives them, even amidst life's chaos.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Methods</h2>

    <p>
      We chose interviews as our primary research method because we wanted to engage in deep, 
      meaningful conversations with users. By asking open-ended questions, we aimed to gather 
      rich qualitative data that would provide us with a more nuanced understanding of their 
      needs and experiences. Additionally, many participants expressed a preference for Zoom 
      interviews, which made the process more convenient and accessible. Our plan was to interview 
      5 to 7 participants, all of whom were relevant to the project, as they either currently 
      seek ways to reflect on their lives or are interested in finding more effective methods 
      for self-reflection. This alignment made their insights especially valuable to our work.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Research Findings</h2>

    <p>
      • Many participants expressed feeling lost and unsure about what to do with their lives.
      <br />
      • Most participants wanted to find a way to reflect on their lives but struggled to do 
      so effectively. 
      <br />
      • A common theme was that being overwhelmed with responsibilities often prevented them 
      from taking the time to reflect. 
      <br />
      • Additionally, several participants mentioned that a lack of motivation, especially 
      after facing challenges, was a key barrier to self-reflection. 
      <br />
      • A few participants did attempt to reflect by taking notes, either in a physical 
      notebook or on their phones, but found this method ineffective due to difficulty 
      organizing or filtering their thoughts.

    <h2>Point of View</h2>
    <p>
      According to our research, we got our Point of View for this aspect which is:
      <br />
      <b style="font-size: large;">“When life becomes busy, it’s easy to lose sight of 
        what truly makes life meaningful. By prompting people to reflect on their daily 
        patterns, we can help them reconnect with the deeper purpose that drives them, 
        offering a reminder of what truly matters amidst the hustle and bustle.”</b> <br />

        After sketching out the stories, we made two paper protoAfter sketching out 
        the user stories, we created two paper prototypes to visualize the key 
        components of our mobile app. To identify areas for improvement before advancing 
        to a high-fidelity design, we conducted three rounds of user testing on the 
        paper prototypes. This allowed us to gather valuable feedback and refine our 
        design based on real user input.types to visualize the main components of our 
        mobile app. In order to find where we would be able to improve before moving 
        on to designing a high fidelity prototype, we conducted three user testing on 
        the paper prototypes.
    </p>
    
    <p class="flow"><b>The primary focus of Prototype 1</b> 
        was on adding activities to the app, with essential details such as Activity 
        Name, Type, Start Time, and End Time. Based on the recorded activities, 
        users would be able to view a weekly report that includes personalized 
        suggestions from the app, helping them reflect on their routines and make
        informed adjustments.</p>

    <h2>User Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      We conducted user testing via Zoom and received valuable feedback from our evaluators. 
      Based on their input, we identified four major issues with our paper prototypes:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <p><b>
          • Lack of Help and Documentation: 
        </b></p>
        <p>
          Two users criticized that some sections of both prototypes were confusing, and 
          having the “Help” section would help improve the “Help and Documentation” aspect. 
          Two users found certain sections of both prototypes confusing. They suggested 
          that adding a "Help" section would greatly improve usability by providing guidance 
          and clarifying features.
        </p>
        <p><b>
          • Lack of Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:
        </b></p>
        <p>
          One user told us that both prototypes were really text heavy. Thus, adding more 
          visuals would improve this aspect for the next steps.One user pointed out that both 
          prototypes were overly text-heavy. They recommended incorporating more visuals and 
          simplifying the design to make the interface more engaging and user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p><b>
          • Lack of Error Prevention:
        </b></p>
        <p>
          There were not enough pages or pop-ups for confirmation to make sure that users 
          did not take action accidentally.Users noted the absence of confirmation pop-ups 
          or error-prevention mechanisms, which could help prevent accidental actions and 
          improve user confidence.
        </p>
        <p><b>
          • Issues with User Control and Freedom:
        </b></p>
        <p>
          In Prototype 1, one user mentioned that there was no option to edit an activity 
          once it was added by mistake. They suggested adding a way to modify or delete 
          activities, giving users greater control over their input.
        </p>

    <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <p class="flow">
        After receiving the feedback from users, we created low fAfter receiving feedback 
        from users, we created a low-fidelity prototype in Figma. This prototype included 
        three main screens: the homepage, the activity input screen, and the weekly report 
        screen. In response to user feedback, we also added more visuals to enhance the 
        design, making it both more aesthetic and minimalist. These changes aimed to 
        improve usability and appeal, while maintaining clarity and simplicity.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mob-track/mobtrack-lo-fi.png"/>

    <hr />

    <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>

    <p class="flow">
        Once we had a clear understanding of the structure of the digital screens, we moved 
        on to creating a high-fidelity prototype. This involved adding colors, refining the 
        visual elements, and incorporating a few additional details to enhance the overall 
        design. The goal was to finalize the look and feel before proceeding to the development 
        phase, where we would implement the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>

    <img src="images/mob-track/mobtrack-hi-fi.png"/>

    <h2>Final Product</h2>

    <p class="flow">
        Using the digital prototypes as a guide, we proceeded to develop our product with 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our initial goal was to ensure that the application 
        closely matched the Figma prototypes in both design and functionality. However, 
        due to time and development constraints, a few features had to be left out. For 
        example, we were unable to implement the option to choose chart types or display 
        activities directly on the homepage. Additionally, the suggestion feature was not 
        fully completed, as we didn’t have enough time to develop the complex logic required 
        for it. Despite these limitations, we were able to deliver a functional version of 
        the app, with plans to enhance it in future iterations.
    </p>
    <p class="flow">
        We also made several improvements based on the feedback from user testing. These 
        included adding a "Help" section to assist users with navigation, implementing 
        confirmation pop-ups for error prevention, and creating an option to edit or 
        delete specific activities in case of mistakes. These updates helped enhance 
        usability and address some of the key concerns raised by users during testing.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>

    <br />

    <p>
      If we were to continue the project, our focus would be on implementing the features 
      that were not yet developed and enhancing the underlying logic to provide more accurate 
      and relevant user suggestions. We would also prioritize refining the visual design to 
      more closely align the application with the Figma prototypes. Furthermore, we intend 
      to conduct additional user testing to gather actionable feedback, allowing us to make 
      data-driven improvements and iterate on the application effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

    <br />

    <p>
      Working remotely with my team taught me valuable lessons, especially during the pandemic. 
      If given the chance to do it again, we would dedicate more time to thoroughly planning tasks, 
      setting clear expectations, and developing contingency plans in case things didn’t go as
      anticipated. One of our key successes was prioritizing the application’s functionality and 
      carefully reviewing it for heuristic errors, which helped ensure a more robust final product.
