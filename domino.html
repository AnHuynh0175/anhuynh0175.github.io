    <h2>Problem Statements</h2>

    <p>
      How can we <b>improve</b> the quality of service for customers who ordered
      <b>CARRYOUT</b> using Domino's Applications under the pandemic?
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      <b>Background:</b> During the pandemic, many customers prefer ordering Domino's pizza 
      through the app, but carryout customers often experience long wait times because in-app orders 
      are mixed with in-store orders. Additionally, only one person is allowed inside the store at a time, 
      forcing others to wait in line outside. To improve the experience, we plan to redesign the Domino's app 
      with a focus on reducing wait times and minimizing contact for carryout customers.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Research Methods</h2>

    <p>
      Our main research goal is to gain a deeper understanding of users' perspectives, 
      recognizing that everyone has unique viewpoints. As designers, we understand 
      that without proper user research, our design could be biased, a common issue 
      in many global design projects. We have chosen interviews as our research method 
      because they allow us to engage in in-depth conversations with users through 
      open-ended questions. This approach will provide us with rich qualitative data 
      for analysis. Our participants, who are familiar with using apps to save time 
      and stay safe during the pandemic, will be interviewed via phone or Zoom. 
      We plan to interview 5 to 7 participants, all of whom are regular pizza eaters 
      and align with the goals of our project.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Research Findings</h2>

    <p>
      1) Most of the people we interviewed, including Domino's employees, said 
      that customers are waiting longer than their ideal time during the pandemic.
      <br />
      2) Some people we interviewed felt not fair because they were placed in
      the order line even though they came to carry out their order. <br />
      3) The employee also complained that they sometimes don’t have enough
      space for cooked-pizzas (keep warm before pick-up) because of stacked
      orders. <br />
      4) Most participants are okay with waiting line but they prefer to reduce
      contact with employees and other customers as much as possible in order to
      be safer. <br />
      5) Additionally, a few participants mention that it would be great to
      reduce the time wearing a mask, since they are not comfortable with
      wearing it. Therefore, they prefer the better options for carry out their
      food if it reduce wearing mask time unless mask is necessary. Also, they
      do not have to stand outside, especially if there are many other people
      also waiting for their food.
    </p>

    <h2>How might we?</h2>
    <p>
      How might we help customers spend less time on waiting to save their time?
      <br />
      How might we help customers reduce time of wearing masks? <br />
      How might we help customers reduce contact with other people under the
      pandemic?<br />
      How might we help employees have an easier time noticing when customers
      come to pick up?<br />
      How might we help employees reduce losing their customers because they
      have to wait for their pizza for a long time?<br />
      How might we help employees not feel frustrated because there are too many
      customers come at the same time?<br />

    <h2>Ux Personas</h2>

    <hr />

    <h2>User Flows</h2>
    <img src="images/domino/sketch-1.png" alt="Flow 1" />

    <p class="flow">
      <b>Flow 1:</b> User Flow 1 is designed for both Adam and Helen personas
      because it offers a new feature which helps customers to save more time
      and employees to identify customers easier. Instead of directly asking
      customer’s or vehicle’s information, this flow allows employees to have
      enough information to know who is in front of the door and what their
      order is. For users, this flow reduces contact with other people under the
      pandemic which is very important for user’s health.
    </p>

    <img src="images/domino/sketch-2.png" alt="Flow 2" />

    <p class="flow">
      <b>Flow 2:</b> Similar to User Flow 1, User Flow 2 is designed for both
      personas mentioned above, and the flow reduces contact with other people
      under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health, by having
      enough information before giving the food instead of directly asking
      customers. Nevertheless, there are a few differences in the process.
      Instead of showing codes in User Flow 1, users can enter their information
      about themselves, including their appearance for picking up in person.
      While the process for “In Car” has the same UX flow, it is actually a
      little bit different about details in Sketches section.
    </p>

    <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <img src="images/domino/lo-fi-1.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      <b>Prototype 1:</b> For this prototype, it has two options to pick up,
      which are “In Person” and “Contactless” (or “In Car”). For “In Person”, it
      has a number on the app that helps employees recognize which food they
      should give to the particular customer. When customers arrive, they can
      show their numbers in front of the restaurant to let employees know. For
      “Contactless”, it has one dropdown option to choose for the type of
      vehicle (motorcycle, sedan, suv, truck, etc.), and one input field for
      license plate number. With that information of the vehicle, it helps
      employees have an easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in,
      in order to quickly give the food to them.
    </p>

    <img src="images/domino/lo-fi-2.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      <b>Prototype 2:</b> Similarly, Prototype 2 also has the same two options
      to pick up. However, there are a few differences in details of what
      information customers can provide to help employees. For “In Person”, it
      asks for the description of customers’ appearance, including
      “Gender/race”, “Shirt Color”, and “Pant Color”. Thus, employees can
      recognize different customers more easily with different details about
      each customer. For “In Car”, it asks for the “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle
      Color”. Similar to Prototype 1, “In Car” option helps employees have an
      easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in, in order to
      quickly give the food to them.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Lo-fi User Testing</h2>
    <p>
      What users liked most about Prototype 1 was it was more simple in “In
      Person” option, since it only showed the number to confirm with the
      employees. While, what they liked most about Prototype 2 was they did not
      have to type license plate numbers, which many people did not remember
      them, and had to go out of the vehicle and check for the numbers.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      For Prototype 1, the only confusion was the confirmation number of the “In
      Person” option, since it was not descriptive enough in order to guide
      customers what to do with it. While, there was no struggling or confusion
      when they used Prototype 2.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Overall, they preferred to use Prototype 1, since it was more simple to
      use, and had less details to fill out.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      For the “In Person” option, they preferred Prototype 1, because they did
      not like to fill out details about their appearance. Additionally, they
      mentioned that asking about “Gender/race” might be sensitive to many
      people, which may lead to uncomfortable situations.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      For the “In Car” option, they did not prefer either prototype.
      Nevertheless, one of the participants suggested having mix options from
      both prototypes for the “In Car” option including “Type of Vehicle”,
      “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle Color”.

    <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>

    <p>
      This high-fidelity prototype combines elements from both of our original 
      UX flows from Milestone 3, based on user feedback. Users expressed a 
      preference for certain features from each flow, so we integrated the 
      most valued aspects into a single design. While the core structure of 
      the flow remained unchanged, the process of selecting and merging the 
      features took some time to ensure the best user experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since our low-fidelity prototypes closely mirrored our original UX flows, 
      the process was similar—combining the most valuable features from both 
      prototypes into one cohesive design. We found that gathering user feedback 
      was incredibly valuable, as it allowed us to gain insights from different 
      perspectives. Additionally, we discovered that there were details we hadn't 
      initially considered in our design process. The feedback from users was 
      instrumental in identifying these areas for improvement, helping us refine 
      the overall design.
      <br />
      <br />
      For the next steps, we plan to conduct another round of testing on our 
      high-fidelity prototype to gather further feedback, particularly on the 
      visual aspects. Additionally, we will take time to reflect on our design 
      process, identifying any areas for improvement. This will help us refine 
      the prototype and ensure we create a more insightful and comprehensive 
      case study.

    <h2>Before and After Stories</h2>

    <p>
      After feedback, we decided to use the alternative screen for “Vehicle
      Carryout”. For the original screen, when users typed information in “Make
      / Model / Brand”, the word “Make / Model / Brand” would disappear. If
      users forgot what information they needed to type in, they had to delete
      everything and started over again. Therefore, putting the word “Make /
      Model / Brand” above the text input field instead of putting it inside
      would help users be able to avoid that situation.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      <b
        >Working in a group doesn't automatically guarantee the best outcomes; 
        it's effective communication that truly drives success. When ideas are 
        shared openly, feedback is valued, and everyone is aligned, that's when 
        the best products are created.</b
      >
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      A great designer is someone who excels at communication—both with users and 
      with fellow designers. By engaging with users, you gain a deeper understanding 
      of the challenges they face. Meanwhile, collaborating with other designers 
      helps you discover innovative solutions to address those challenges, creating 
      a more effective and thoughtful design.
