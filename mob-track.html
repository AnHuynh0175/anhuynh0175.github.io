    <h2>Problem Statements</h2>

    <p>
      How can we <b>improve</b> the quality of service for customers who ordered
      <b>CARRYOUT</b> using Domino's Applications under the pandemic?
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      <b>Background:</b> Under the pandemic, customers prefer to order domino
      pizza online using the Domino's application. At the store, only one person
      is allowed to go inside and the other must get in line outside the store.
      However, carryout customers have to wait too long in the line just pick up
      the pizzas which they have already ordered because in-app ordered
      customers are mixed with in-store ordered customers. Therefore, we plan to
      redesign domino's application because we believe that reducing the wait
      time and contact should be a highest priority for carryout customers.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Research Methods</h2>

    <p>
      Our main research goal is to have a better understanding of users’
      perspectives, especially everyone has different points of view. As
      designers, we know that if we do not have proper user research, we might
      have our design plan with biased perspective, that has happened a lot in
      many designs around the world. We chose interviews as a research method.
      The reason we chose this particular method was because we would like to
      talk in depth with users, and have open ended questions. Therefore, we
      would have more qualitative information, and there would be more to
      analyze. Also, our users would like to talk with us by calling through
      phones, or using Zoom. For our plan, we are going to interview about 5 to
      7 people for our project. Additionally, the participants are relevant to
      our project because they often eat pizza, and would like to use an app to
      save their time, and be safer during the pandemic.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Research Findings</h2>

    <p>
      1) Most people we interviewed including domino’s employee said that
      customers have to wait longer than their ideal time in the pandemic.
      <br />
      2) Some people we interviewed felt not fair because they were placed in
      the order line even though they came to carry out their order. <br />
      3) The employee also complained that they sometimes don’t have enough
      space for cooked-pizzas (keep warm before pick-up) because of stacked
      orders. <br />
      4) Most participants are okay with waiting line but they prefer to reduce
      contact with employees and other customers as much as possible in order to
      be safer. <br />
      5) Additionally, a few participants mention that it would be great to
      reduce the time wearing a mask, since they are not comfortable with
      wearing it. Therefore, they prefer the better options for carry out their
      food if it reduce wearing mask time unless mask is necessary. Also, they
      do not have to stand outside, especially if there are many other people
      also waiting for their food.
    </p>

    <h2>How might we?</h2>
    <p>
      How might we help customers spend less time on waiting to save their time?
      <br />
      How might we help customers reduce time of wearing masks? <br />
      How might we help customers reduce contact with other people under the
      pandemic?<br />
      How might we help employees have an easier time noticing when customers
      come to pick up?<br />
      How might we help employees reduce losing their customers because they
      have to wait for their pizza for a long time?<br />
      How might we help employees not feel frustrated because there are too many
      customers come at the same time?<br />

    <h2>Ux Personas</h2>

    <hr />

    <h2>User Flows</h2>
    <img src="images/domino/sketch-1.png" alt="Flow 1" />

    <p class="flow">
      <b>Flow 1:</b> User Flow 1 is designed for both Adam and Helen personas
      because it offers a new feature which helps customers to save more time
      and employees to identify customers easier. Instead of directly asking
      customer’s or vehicle’s information, this flow allows employees to have
      enough information to know who is in front of the door and what their
      order is. For users, this flow reduces contact with other people under the
      pandemic which is very important for user’s health.
    </p>

    <img src="images/domino/sketch-2.png" alt="Flow 2" />

    <p class="flow">
      <b>Flow 2:</b> Similar to User Flow 1, User Flow 2 is designed for both
      personas mentioned above, and the flow reduces contact with other people
      under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health, by having
      enough information before giving the food instead of directly asking
      customers. Nevertheless, there are a few differences in the process.
      Instead of showing codes in User Flow 1, users can enter their information
      about themselves, including their appearance for picking up in person.
      While the process for “In Car” has the same UX flow, it is actually a
      little bit different about details in Sketches section.
    </p>

    <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <img src="images/domino/lo-fi-1.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      <b>Prototype 1:</b> For this prototype, it has two options to pick up,
      which are “In Person” and “Contactless” (or “In Car”). For “In Person”, it
      has a number on the app that helps employees recognize which food they
      should give to the particular customer. When customers arrive, they can
      show their numbers in front of the restaurant to let employees know. For
      “Contactless”, it has one dropdown option to choose for the type of
      vehicle (motorcycle, sedan, suv, truck, etc.), and one input field for
      license plate number. With that information of the vehicle, it helps
      employees have an easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in,
      in order to quickly give the food to them.
    </p>

    <img src="images/domino/lo-fi-2.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      <b>Prototype 2:</b> Similarly, Prototype 2 also has the same two options
      to pick up. However, there are a few differences in details of what
      information customers can provide to help employees. For “In Person”, it
      asks for the description of customers’ appearance, including
      “Gender/race”, “Shirt Color”, and “Pant Color”. Thus, employees can
      recognize different customers more easily with different details about
      each customer. For “In Car”, it asks for the “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle
      Color”. Similar to Prototype 1, “In Car” option helps employees have an
      easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in, in order to
      quickly give the food to them.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Lo-fi User Testing</h2>
    <p>
      What users liked most about Prototype 1 was it was more simple in “In
      Person” option, since it only showed the number to confirm with the
      employees. While, what they liked most about Prototype 2 was they did not
      have to type license plate numbers, which many people did not remember
      them, and had to go out of the vehicle and check for the numbers.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      For Prototype 1, the only confusion was the confirmation number of the “In
      Person” option, since it was not descriptive enough in order to guide
      customers what to do with it. While, there was no struggling or confusion
      when they used Prototype 2.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Overall, they preferred to use Prototype 1, since it was more simple to
      use, and had less details to fill out.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      For the “In Person” option, they preferred Prototype 1, because they did
      not like to fill out details about their appearance. Additionally, they
      mentioned that asking about “Gender/race” might be sensitive to many
      people, which may lead to uncomfortable situations.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      For the “In Car” option, they did not prefer either prototype.
      Nevertheless, one of the participants suggested having mix options from
      both prototypes for the “In Car” option including “Type of Vehicle”,
      “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle Color”.

    <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>

    <p>
      This high-fidelity prototype actually implements the mix of both of our
      original UX Flows in Milestone 3, since we got feedback from the users
      that they prefer some features of the first flow, while they also prefer
      some features of the second flow. Therefore, we did not have to change our
      flow technically, even though it took a bit to select the features from
      both flows to combine into one high fidelity prototype.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since our low fidelity prototypes are almost the same with our original UX
      flows, the process was the same, that we combined the features from both
      prototypes into one prototype. We learned that this was really good to
      have feedback from users, that we could learn more from different
      perspectives. We also realized that sometimes there were details that we
      did not recognize during our design process, and the users actually helped
      us a lot in spotting the details that we need to improve for our design.
      <br />
      <br />
      For our plans for next steps, we are going to have another testing on our
      high fidelity prototype, in order to have more feedback, especially on the
      visual aspects. Additionally, we are planning to reflect our process, so
      we can see if there are more aspects that we can improve, and have a more
      insightful case study.

    <h2>Before and After Stories</h2>

    <p>
      After feedback, we decided to use the alternative screen for “Vehicle
      Carryout”. For the original screen, when users typed information in “Make
      / Model / Brand”, the word “Make / Model / Brand” would disappear. If
      users forgot what information they needed to type in, they had to delete
      everything and started over again. Therefore, putting the word “Make /
      Model / Brand” above the text input field instead of putting it inside
      would help users be able to avoid that situation.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      <b
        >Working in a group does not always create the best products.
        Communication does.</b
      >
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      A good designer is the one who knows how to communicate with users and
      other designers. Communicating with the users will help you know the
      problems that they are facing while communicating with other designers
      will give you the solutions for those problems.
